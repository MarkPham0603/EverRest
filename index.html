                    <p>I've been working in HCM for 19 years. I am proficient in both Vietnamese and English. I had an interest in the data field when I had a chance to visit a workshop on careers in the data field. I'm fascinated by how people in the data industry can develop meaningful insights by analyzing datasets or how they can make actionable strategies for their company or organization by interpreting the results of data analysis, processing, and modeling. Throughout my RMIT learning journey. I've built up my skills in C++, Java, Python, and SQL. In addition to technical skills, I have experience in cleansing, modeling and visualizing data to provide insights. I am also self-learning R programming, Alteryx and Machine Learning models.</p>

                    <p>I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh city which is in the south of Vietnam. Fortunately, I have studied in an International school since primary school until the end of high school, so I can speak quite fluently English. School is not the only thing that helps me to learn English well, but also games have taught me many new words. Therefore, it is my favorite hobby, but it also leads me to troubles because I spend lots of time on it. However, it is the reason why I choose to study IT to support my future job which is Game Development. Before this first semester, I have finished studying C Programming and have a little bit of experience about Java. Moreover, during this course, I have learned some basic information about Python and SQL. In the IT field only, I do not know many things yet, but I will try to figure out and learn more new knowledge.</p>

                    <p>First of all, our group has been working together for more than 4 weeks. It seems like until now we have not had any problems. Everybody is working on their part really well. However, at the beginning, there was an issue with a member who was not responding, but then our group solved it smoothly. Everyone in the group is kind, respectful, and ready to help each other. Due to the fact that we combine between online and offline, I think it is really convenient for discussing and sharing ideas. We're almost finished with our project. I'm hoping it'll turn out fantastic after we're done.</p>
