                    <p>I've been working in HCM for 19 years. I am proficient in both Vietnamese and English. I had an interest in the data field when I had a chance to visit a workshop on careers in the data field. I'm fascinated by how people in the data industry can develop meaningful insights by analyzing datasets or how they can make actionable strategies for their company or organization by interpreting the results of data analysis, processing, and modeling. Throughout my RMIT learning journey. I've built up my skills in C++, Java, Python, and SQL. In addition to technical skills, I have experience in cleansing, modeling and visualizing data to provide insights. I am also self-learning R programming, Alteryx and Machine Learning models.</p>
